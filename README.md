# LibraryManagementSystem
A library assistant software for general purposes of any library. This was made using
**JavaFX**.<br>
Open new JavaFX project from __NetBeans__ and just replace **this 'src' folder** with your project's default 'src' folder.<br>
<br>
## Libraries, should be imported
jfoenix.jar (probably you have to download this)<br>
derby.jar & derbyclient.jar (search for these in your jdk folder)<br><br>
Now you can fire up the execute button
